### ES6 Boilerplate

This ES6 boilerplate provides a basic setup for building modern JavaScript applications using Webpack. It includes development and production configurations.

#### Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code directory.
- `dist/`: Output directory for bundled files.
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration for development.
- `prod.config.js`: Webpack configuration for production.

#### Scripts

- **Start Development Server:**
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
  Starts the development server using `webpack-dev-server` and opens the application in the default web browser.

- **Build Development Bundle:**
  ```bash
  npm build
  ```
  Builds the development bundle with Webpack in watch mode.

- **Build Production Bundle:**
  ```bash
  npm run prod
  ```
  Builds the production bundle with Webpack using the `prod.config.js` configuration.

#### Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Use the provided scripts to start the development server, build development bundles, or build production bundles.

Feel free to explore and modify the configurations based on your educational needs.
